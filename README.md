- https://rainsoft.io/what-every-javascript-developer-should-know-about-unicode/ : Unicode 9: 128172 characters, Domain: Codepoint, Planes, Code unit, Character name, Astract Symbol, Surrogate Pairs, Encoding, Graphème, Symbol, Glyph, Combining Mark. In JS: .length = nb of code units (surrogate pairs = 2cu, so it's just wrong), "\u0020" in JS. For astral (>0xFFFF) use surrogate pairs = 2 code points (\u*2) or \u{12345} in ES6. String normalization (because multiple way to represent a same symbol, need a canonical form). JS: str.normalize(). [...str] or Array.from(str) (@@iterator) has the good length (deal with unicode and surrogates) (str.length = 5 but [...str].length = 4). str.codePointAt(index). String.fromCodePoint(cp). If used in regexes, use /.../u otherwise it sucks and fails.
