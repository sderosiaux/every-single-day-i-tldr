# _Almost_ every single day I TLDR!

Here, I list all the articles, blog posts, pages I've read, or videos I've watched, that I found interesting.
It's like a huge shared bookmarks registry with y'all! Or it's like a daily newsletter without newsletter. Use Ctrl+F and find what you want. Fun fact: Github only displays the readme until ~5000 lines.

I'm reading mostly about Scala, Data Engineering, Java, Javascript, Big Data, DDD, and technology. :muscle:

- I'm the co-founder of https://www.conduktor.io/, the best Desktop application to manage a Kafka ecosystem. Download, Install, Connect, done!
- I'm writing articles on my [blog](https://www.sderosiaux.com/) about these topics.

An "assembler": the service that fulfill dependencies. 3 types of IoC: Interface Injection, Setter Injection, Constructor Injection. Another pattern is the Service Locator (basically, a class Registry (singleton or not) where you load or ask for an implementation). Both patterns can be mixed. With the Locator, every classes needs a reference to a Locator. With IoC, there is no such thing, it's completely invisible. XML sucks.

In JS: .length = nb of code units (surrogate pairs = 2cu, so it's just wrong), "\u0020" in JS. For astral (>0xFFFF) use surrogate pairs = 2 code points (\u\*2) or \u{12345} in ES6. String normalization (because multiple way to represent a same symbol, need a canonical form). JS: str.normalize(). [...str] or Array.from(str) (@@iterator) has the good length (deal with unicode and surrogates) (str.length = 5 but [...str].length = 4). str.codePointAt(index). String.fromCodePoint(cp). If used in regexes, use /.../u otherwise it sucks and fails.
